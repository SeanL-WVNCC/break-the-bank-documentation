# 03/03/2025 Meeting summary - Josephine P.
The meeting began with a recap of the last week of work, the three vulnerabilities
added, and new implementation suggestions.
## Vulnerabilities added:
* File upload vulnerability
* User enumeration vulnerability
* SQL injection vulnerability
## Suggestions are as follows:
* Limit the file upload vulnerability so the server does not crash in the future
* Create a Denial of Service (DOS) attack by having no filter and adding a flag to congratulate the student
* Populate the error message from SQL injection into a pop up instead of the bottom of the screen
* Generate 50-60 users for session hijacking/user enumeration CSRF token with session ID's, make them vulnerable CyberSec Team explain how to implement CSRF onto the website
* Research the use of Microsoft products to employ for the website, since they partner with WVNCC: user logs, inputs, gantt chart etc...
* Input fake data into website through "news websites" for future DOM based attacks
## To Do by Monday 3/10
Five (5) different vulnerabilities implemented within the website, preferably:
* Stored cross-site scripting (XSS), Cross-site request forgery (CSRF), Click-jacking, Session Hijacking, + one more
* Better changes to website appearance (UI)
* Remove the placeholder text within website, create actual text filler related to site
