# 01/27/2025 Meeting 1 summary - Prof. Jeremy Doolin
Iâ€™m sorry that I had to miss the meeting. I do have several thoughts that I would like to share. 
## Project Components
* Host platform
    * OS
    * Web server
    * Database server
    * Other support services
    * Security policy
* Database backend
    * Schema Design and Implementation 
    * Sample Data
* Web page frontend
    * HTML/CSS
    * Javascript
    * Bootstrap
* PHP Backend
    * Site navigation
    * Database API
    * Form Handling
    * Authentication
## Managing the Project
* Someone should be creating a GIT repository for both code and documentation
    * All team members will need a GitHub account
* Use something like a Kanban board for task management
    * Github has one built-in
* Choose/create a GIT workflow
* Create a communication plan 
    * Establish which channels will be used and for what purposes
        * In-person/Zoom meetings
        * Discord
        * Email
## Other Notes
* Recommend open source software for speed, cost, easy license management, and low hardware requirements
    * Linux/BSD
    * Apache, nginx
    * MySQL, PostGRESQL
* Use PHP for the backend due to familiarity and ease of creating the vulnerabilities
* The web site may be vulnerable, but the server should otherwise be secure
* There are enough parts and components that there should be roles and tasks for everyone

I would be happy to oversee development aspects of the project, but when it comes to the list of vulnerabilities, I think Vikram would need to verify those. I also think that the developers should also have to write secure/fixed versions of the same vulnerable code. I would also be able to host the development server/system in my office. We could theoretically get away with a Raspberry Pi, and I have extras we can use. But I will not be doing any of the installation/setup of the device. I will give the necessary network information for connecting the device and configure the firewall to allow remote access. 
So, those are my thoughts and additions. Any amendments or suggestions?
