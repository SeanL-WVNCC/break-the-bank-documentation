## Summary:
We have discussed the project overview and came up with the following,
* We will be meeting twice a week on Mondays and Wednesdays from 01:30 to 02:30 PM.
* Grant won’t be able to attend these but will follow through with project summaries and on discord
* Wyatt created the following discord link for collaborating on the project
    * https://discord.gg/6TbKjrn4
* By 02/03/2025 we agreed on getting the following objectives done,
    * What type of website are we building
    * Create a name and logo for our website
    * Create the following web pages,
        * Home Page
        * Feedback Page
        * Contact US Page
        * Login Page
        * Sign Up Page
            * About Us Page
            * Profile Page
            * A page with upload functionality
        * Note: You can create more webpages if you can and have the home page ready enough (referring to style and design) to set a tone for the rest of the website.
    * Grant might have to drop of the project due to a potential job offer.
    * By 02/03/2025 Grant and Josephine will come up with few comments or error messages that appear on success or failure of the attacks. (I think Kevin left from the meeting at this point so, through this email, I am requesting him to come up with some comments as well).
    * Cyber security students will make their own web pages just to get the feel of how a web site is designed and that might give them more ideas on attacks. (these pages don’t need to be fancy as it is something like a side quest in a video game).
## Other updates:
* I have received applications from couple of other students showing interest in the project and I will add them to this email.
    * Sean Lauritzen from Software Engineering will be joining the team.
    * The other student hasn’t put their official application yet so, I will add them when they apply.
    * Wyatt and Angela please explain Sean on the web developer responsibilities.
* I would like you guys to come up with roles that you would like to assume for this project such as, principal developer, lead security engineer or something on those lines so you can use that on your resumes.
* If I miss anything please respond to this email so, everyone is on the same page.
See you on 02/03/2024 at 01:30 PM. Let me know if you have any questions.
PS: I will send the zoom link for future meetings once I get a chance.
